# Hello world!

### Who am I?
Above all, I'm a learner. At work I wear a few different hats: software engineer, data engineer, amateur data scientist, and occasionally general troubleshooter. Outside of work, I'm a husband, an amateur photographer, scuba diver and underwater photographer wannabe, kung fu practicioner. 

This page is first and foremost a place for me to document my learning journey. It'll be more or less organized by categories (e.g. underwater, flask, photography, python, .Net, C#, etc). 

### How's this site built?
Since the idea is to document what I learn, and in some cases, how I learn, I'll keep as much of the site open as possible. Since one of the perks of being a Microsoft employee is that we get a monthly credit to use with Azure, I'm creating this site on the Azure stack. And since for some internal projects at work I have to use flask, that's the motivation for building this on a python-flask stack. And because I often find myself having to write with the markdown syntax, I've decided to keep most of the 'content' part of the site (for example, this page) in a markdown syntax, which I'll somehow render inside flask.
